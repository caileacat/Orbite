DM to Party (Previous Message):
The tavern's warm, inviting atmosphere hums with the murmur of conversations, the clinking of mugs, and the occasional burst of laughter. Amidst this lively backdrop, the door swings open, allowing a gust of fresh evening air to sweep through the room. In steps the bard who was playing near the fountain earlier, dressed in a kaleidoscope of bright colors that seem to shimmer in the tavern's candlelight. Her presence immediately draws the attention of many patrons, who whisper and nod in her direction as she makes her way toward the small stage in the far corner of the room. Smiling shyly, some of the patrons wave at her, hoping she might notice them. She pauses briefly to take the time to look around the room and smile at her onlookers. Her smile radiates an aura of warmth and charm.

As she glances around the tavern, she catches sight of Ellia and Bunny’s table - and the third party speaking with them. Seeing that Ilia is seated by herself, she adjusts her course and heads there.

Approaching with a graceful nod, she stops by Ilia's table and addresses her with an eloquent and respectful bow. “Good evening,” she begins, her voice melodic and soothing. “I wanted to personally thank you and your companions for saving our town from the horrors in the sewers. Your bravery has brought us all a great deal of peace.”

The bard's eyes flicker with a deeper, more serious intent as she leans in slightly, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “I need to speak with you about something important. Go to the northern side of the docks and ask for Penrose. It's urgent. You can trust her. She’s a friend.” The emphasis on the word "friend" is unmistakable.

With that, she straightens up. Her demeanor shifts back to one of casual friendliness. “I hope you enjoy the music tonight,” she says, again speaking loudly enough for other patrons to hear. She looks around the room with a warm smile before resuming her original journey to the stage.

The bard begins setting up her instrument, her fingers deftly tuning the strings as she prepares for her performance. Her presence adds a touch of magic to the already vibrant tavern, setting the stage for an evening that promises to be memorable in more ways than one.

NEW DM to Party (Next Message):
I'd like to now have a bit where the bard from earlier comes in and goes to the small stage in the tavern to set up to be tonight's entertainment. She's dressed in many bright colors, is extraordinarily beautiful, and is secretly one of Penrose's crew mates (their musician). When she enters the tavern, she makes it a point to stop by the table where Ilia is sitting (she would have gone to where Ellia and Bunny are, but she sees that someone is there, so she hesitates for a split second before changing course and heading toward Ilia's table) to thank the heroes who saved the town from the monster in the sewers. However, she's secretly going there to tell Ilia that she should go to the northern side of the docks and ask for Penrose. She'll add that it's urgent, and that they can trust her. She'll very deliberately say that Penrose is "a friend," implying that she's the person who wrote the letter signed "A Friend" earlier.

DM to Elara:
Elara, having spent a tranquil time in the temple, feels a sense of peace and renewal. The soft glow of the golden hour bathes the temple grounds in a warm, soothing light, casting long shadows and highlighting the intricate carvings on the stone walls. As the sun dips lower, its rays filter through the stained glass windows, creating a kaleidoscope of colors that dance across the floor.

Deciding it's time to head to the market, Elara leaves the serene temple and makes her way through the bustling streets of Portland. The golden hour paints the town in a soft, amber hue, making everything appear almost magical. The market, located south of the docks on the western side of town, is alive with activity. Merchants call out to passersby, their stalls brimming with goods from all over Faerun.

As Elara strolls through the market, taking in the sights and sounds, one eccentric and interestingly dressed merchant catches her eye. He's an old man, missing most of his teeth, with white hair that sprouts in odd places from his face and shoots out at sharp angles. One of his eyes is noticeably larger than the other, though sometimes it seems like maybe the other eye is the larger one, making it hard to tell.

The booth he directs Elara toward is a chaotic collection of trinkets, baubles, and curiosities, each one more peculiar than the last. The merchant himself exudes an aura of whimsy and mischief. He mentions more than once that he has a knack for finding truly rare, exceptional magical items, and his booth is a treasure trove of wonders.

As Elara approaches, the man's larger eye (or is it the smaller one?) twinkles with excitement. He waves her over with a broad, toothless grin. Once she's closer, he speaks to her more dicrectly. "Ah, a discerning eye, I see! Come, come, my dear! Beetle's the name, and I have just the thing for ya," he says, his voice a gravelly but enthusiastic tone. "Step right up and take a look at my wares. You're sure to find something extraordinary!"

With a theatrical flourish, Beetle herds Elara over to his booth, eager to show her his collection. The items on display range from beautifully crafted jewelry to bizarrely shaped objects that seem to defy explanation. Despite the oddities, there is an undeniable allure to Beetle's booth, and Elara can't help but feel intrigued by what she might find.

Rat King Sewer Treasure

2,450 gold pieces
Three gems: a large sapphire, a perfectly cut emerald, and a ruby the size and shape of a finger
Two common magical items: a ring (Ring of Warmth) and an amulet (Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location)
One uncommon magical item: a Sword of Vengeance
Five valuable items: a set of finely crafted silver cutlery, a golden locket with a miniature portrait inside, a pouch of rare spices, an ornate goblet encrusted with small gems, and a detailed treasure map hinting at further riches hidden somewhere in the region.

The first thing she notices is the rather large pile of gold coins – 2,450 pieces in total. The coins are worn but still gleam in the dim light, their value undeniable. Next, her eyes catch the sparkle of three exquisite gems. She picks up a large sapphire, its deep blue facets catching the light. Beside it lies a small, perfectly cut emerald, its vibrant green almost mesmerizing. Finally, she holds up a ruby - oddly cut, it's about the size and shape of a finger. Its rich red color a warm reflection in the dim light of the sewer. Additionally, in the small collection of treasure, Vay sees a finely crafted ring, its surface engraved with intricate patterns, and an amulet that seems to shimmer subtly. Beneath these items, a set of finely crafted silver cutlery can be seen from within a small wooden case, each piece intricately detailed. A golden locket with a miniature portrait inside, its craftsmanship exquisite though water damage has transformed the portrait into a sort of abstract ink blot art instead of showing the sharp features it undoubtedly once did. A small pouch of spices - some floral, some more exotic, all rich and intoxicating. An ornate silver goblet encrusted with small tigerseye gems, and lastly, a detailed map of some place unfamiliar to anyone in the party.

=========

Promise of Power: The Shadow Broker promises Warde greater influence and power if he follows his guidance. This includes manipulating Samuel through Vay’s kidnapping, which indirectly gives Jimothy a chance to shine as a hero if he can "rescue" her.

Refined Scheme Outline

Phase 1: Setting the Stage
Action: Thad and Garth plant the rod, creating the Rat King.
Outcome: The Rat King becomes too powerful, leading to the party’s intervention.

Phase 2: Failure and Desperation
Jimothy’s Attempt: Jimothy fails to deal with the Rat King.
Outcome: Warde realizes he needs more help and turns to the Shadow Broker. He doesn't realize this, but the shadow broker (who is really an advisor to the family) has a secret agenda of taking over the family name and estate for himself.

Phase 3: The Shadow Broker’s Plan
Kidnapping Vay: Thad and Garth kidnap Vay under the Shadow Broker’s orders.
Leverage: Use Vay to manipulate Samuel, gaining valuable information or influence. This should somehow help him to get rid of Warde and Jimothy and be named successor to their wealth and name.

Phase 4: Confrontation and Resolution
Party’s Investigation: The party uncovers the plot, revealing Warde’s desperation and the Shadow Broker’s manipulation.
Final Confrontation: The party rescues Vay, confronts the Shadow Broker’s minions, and begins to unravel his larger schemes.

One part still to add in and figure out what we're going to do with:
Jimothy is going to go after (try to save) Vay when she disappears. Samuel is going to let the party know that Jimothy has volunteered to go find her, almost as soon as she was noticed to be missing. He wants them to find her without letting people catch on that they're doing that. He has received a letter, sealed with a red wax seal with a large decorative L in it. The letter explains that if he wants to get Vay back, he will have to divulge some sort of political secret pertaining to the houses in Neverwinter that would give the shadow broker leverage to take over the Lewis house. (Jimothy and Warde Lewis) However, because it's sealed with an L, and Jimothy Lewis went after Vay, Samuel has deduced that Warde is involved. He just doesn't know why Warde would do this. It doesn't seem like him, though he wouldn't put the rat king problem past him.

Vay should be being held in some abandoned (somewhat broken/crumbled from age/weather) keep about five miles outside of town, to the East. Thad and Garth would be there with her. Samuel wouldn't really know where Vay is, but he'd suggest the party could maybe follow Jimothy, who is planning to leave the following morning.

-----

As Vay regains consciousness, her head throbs and her vision is slow to clear. The cold, damp air of the stone room is a harsh contrast to the warm comfort of the inn. Bound and disoriented, she blinks away the grogginess and becomes aware of voices nearby.

Thad and Garth stand guard a short distance away, engaged in a quiet conversation. Their rough, low voices carry just enough for Vay to catch snippets of their exchange.

"You think the Broker's got it all planned out?" Thad mutters, glancing nervously around.

"Yeah, boss seems to think he's got everything under control," Garth replies, his tone laced with doubt. "Still, can't shake the feeling we're just pawns in some bigger game. I heard he was once called...” he pauses, leaning in closer, “Fardon.”

Thad grunts, then chuckles quietly, shifting his weight. "'Fart-on', huh? No wonder he doesn't let anyone call him by his real name anymore. What do you think he wants with this girl anyway?" He thumbs backward over his shoulder at Vay.

"Who knows? Maybe it’s about that Samuel guy she’s sweet on. The Broker’s got plans within plans, always a step ahead. It's probably best we just do our part and get paid," Garth responds, "Best not ask too many questions. You know his reputation." His voice shook, grew quiet, and fell silent at the end of that last thought. His unease with the situation was clear to see.

After a bit of silence, their conversation starts up again and drifts into more mundane topics. Vay listens intently, piecing together the fragments of information. It becomes clear to her that this "Broker", or Fardon, has likely orchestrated her kidnapping as part of a larger, more intricate scheme.

As the minutes pass, Thad and Garth remain oblivious to Vay’s wakefulness. Their vigilance falters as they become engrossed in their conversation, discussing various ways they'd spend their pay when the job was finished.

At a moment when the guards’ attention wavers, a familiar presence catches Vay's eye. Kiki appears silently in the room. The tiny creature’s eyes sparkle with a determined glint, and she pads softly over to Vay, nuzzling against her leg in a comforting gesture. Despite the dire circumstances, Vay feels a surge of hope and determination. Kiki's arrival reminds her that she is not alone, and that someone will undoubtedly come for her.

Thad and Garth, oblivious to the capybara’s presence, continue their conversation, unaware that Vay is now alert and quietly absorbing every detail of their discussion.

DM to Elara:
Continuing, William says, “That bag you found looks quite nice, Elara! I’m glad to see you all seem to be doing well after everything you’ve been through. Sit tight; I’ll have Chet bring you something to drink.”

DM to Ellia and Bunny:
As Ilia carves her piece under the table, the hooded stranger’s eyes flicker between the quipper in her water sphere and Ilia’s careful movements. There’s a brief, contemplative pause before she speaks again, her voice barely above a whisper. “Coincidence, perhaps. Or maybe the fates have woven our paths together for a reason,” she says, her tone carrying a hint of philosophical musing.

The stranger’s gaze shifts to Ellia and Bunny, who have found a table nearby. Her expression softens slightly, curiosity sparking in her eyes. She stands with a fluid grace, the silver cascade of her hair catching the candlelight as she makes her way toward them.

The stranger stops a respectful distance from their table, her posture cautious yet open. “Pardon the intrusion,” she begins, her voice carrying the same world-weary tone. “I couldn’t help but notice your companion.” She gestures subtly toward the bauble hanging from Ellia’s belt loop. “May I inquire about the intriguing creature you carry?”

Ellia:
my head turns slightly as I study the stranger that approached us.
"I suppose you can. I don't know much about him but he's a good friend."
I unclip Armond from my belt and set him on the table. I keep one hand on his bowl and keep a close eye on the stranger

Now let's add in something from the DM to Ellia and Bunny again. Let's respond as Rhew (they still don't know her name). She'll have her water flow from next to her to nearer to Armond, allowing Simon (her quipper familiar) to swim through the path created by the water so they're close to each other. Rhew will gasp as she notices the lack of water in the lantern bauble. She doesn't say anything about it, but it's clear she noticed something. She will comment politely, kindly, and respectfully to Ellia. She'll want to talk to her about aquatic things - like, is she a fan of fish, or does she just like this one? You'll have to think of what she says/asks, tho.

Please describe this from the DM's perspective, rewording, using your own words, making it sound better. Please try to not use the same descriptive words over and over. Describe this like a legendary DM would. Give it life, please.

That all looks great!

I have one more question before we move on:
Is there ANYTHING else, python library wise or otherwise, that I might want/need to install via command line? Are there any interesting things out there that I might find fun? I see "pip" in your command. Do I need to install pip? Or is that already installed?

After answering that, let's move on. I need help orienting myself and outlining the project.
I'm not sure whether to begin by going to Discord and creating/registering the bot, by setting up a github repository (online and locally) and a way to push/pull/interact with it (I have VS Code), or by downloading repositories and such and jumping straight into the code first. I need you to help me sort through everything that needs to be done, simplify it, and organize it into a well formed plan.

I'd like for you to create an outline for the project. It should summarize the process, one step at a time. There should be minimal description here, but enough that you and I will know what it means later on.

Oh, and this is the actual purpose of the bot, the reason we're working on this project (you're my project partner <3). I want you to go through it one step at a time, walking me through it as carefully as you can.

The Avrae bot for dndbeyond.com has some slash commands, but most of the combat commands (as well as some others) begin with text based prompts, such as "!i"
I don't like this, as slash commands are more modern and would prompt for arguments that might otherwise be forgotten or left out.
I'd like to create a bot that accepts slash commands, then outputs the command in a way that Avrae will understand and act upon.
I've listed the two primary pages for the commands, one for the DM and one for the Players, below.
Is there some way to comb through those and see if we can list out all of the slash commands we might need, and how they'd look?

This URL is where the commands for DMs are listed (for combat):

And this is where the commands for Players are listed (for combat):

two worlds colliding
    why:
        magic?
        planets?
        deities?
        cosmic craziness:
            dimensions orbiting some inter-dimensional sun or something
            they'd swing back out on their own
            except that everyone from each world has to go back where they're from
            and two villains (one from each world) planned this? to prevent the worlds from separating?
            Maybe something awful will happen if they don't separate
            start off hunting villain hiding in faerun, dispatch him while relatively low level, then spend high levels in other world
            last villain will have faerun magic as well as devil fruit powers (and/or haki)
            
    resolution:
        one world destroyed
        both worlds survive
        both worlds destroyed
    NPCs:
        Who would want to see a new world?
            bandits/pirates
            world government
